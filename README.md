# Quantitative Economics
A collection of computational methods for conducting research in economics and finance. Files included:

## The Static General Equilibrium Model
- Social planner solution to the static general equilibrium model: [planner_static_1.R.](https://github.com/montesinosmv/quant_econ/blob/master/static_ge_model/planner_static_1.R)
- Market solution to the static general equilibrium model: [market_static_1.R](https://github.com/montesinosmv/quant_econ/blob/master/static_ge_model/market_static_1.R)

## Introduction to Dynamic Programming
- All-in-one solution to the cake-eating problem: [cake_eating_all_in_one.ipynb](https://github.com/manuelmontesinos/quant_econ/blob/master/intro_dynamic_programming/cake_eating_all_in_one.ipynb), (for a Julia version see [prog08_01.jl](https://github.com/montesinosmv/quant_econ/blob/master/intro_dynamic_programming/prog08_01.jl)).
- Analytical solution to the cake-eating problem: [cake_eating_analytic.ipynb](https://github.com/manuelmontesinos/quant_econ/blob/master/intro_dynamic_programming/cake_eating_analytic.ipynb), (for a Julia version see [prog08_02.jl](https://github.com/montesinosmv/quant_econ/blob/master/intro_dynamic_programming/prog08_02.jl)).
